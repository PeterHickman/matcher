# matcher

This is a re-invented wheel. C has a function to pattern match (not regex) file names. Go has a similar function, `filepath.Match`, but it is "enchanced" with special features and conditions

When I try and use it sometimes it works, othertimes it doesnt. When it fails I have no idea why

So I had to write my own
